## Examples

Four example configurations are included in the Examples folder within the module. 
All four examples also use the **xCredSSP** and **xSQLServer** modules. 
Note: the samples require the use of [Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398175).

Note: In the Examples folder you will see a version of each file with "-TP" appended to the name. 
These are the equivalent examples for deployment of System Center Technical Preview on Windows Server Technical Preview.
